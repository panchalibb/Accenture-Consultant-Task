# Accenture-Consultant-Task

Project Overview
This simulation project replicates a real-world consulting engagement with a hypothetical client, Digital Health, a European healthcare company. The aim was to support their digital transformation by improving the user experience (UX) of their mobile appointment-booking app.

Task Description
The project was divided into several key tasks to simulate a six-week consulting engagement:

1. Understand the Client’s Needs
  - Review a client brief from Digital Health.
  - Identify and prioritize 3 core issues: poor UX, inconsistent app usage data, and lack of external best practices.

2. Plan the Project
  - Develop an 8-step project timeline across three categories: Current State, Design, and Rollout.
  - Allocate timeframes (1–2 weeks) to each task and structure activities logically over 6 weeks.

3. Design UX Improvements
  - Analyze screen traffic, booking drop-offs, and user complaints.
  - Identify and recommend 3 quick-win UX changes with high impact and low implementation cost.

4. Monitor and Analyze Results
  - Assess app usage data pre- and post-UX changes.
  - Measure the increase in successful bookings (from ~28/day to 86/day) and a drop in average booking time.

5. Manage a System Issue
  - Investigate and report a system bug that caused duplicate bookings for first-time users in Denmark.
  - Communicate with the client, acknowledge the issue, propose temporary fixes, and coordinate with the IT team.

6. Prioritize Future Initiatives
  - Evaluate 10+ long-term initiatives using an Impact vs. Ease matrix.
  - Recommend 5 initiatives within a €1.3M budget, balancing short- and long-term strategic value.

Key Outcomes
1. Identified 3 immediate UX priorities using client feedback and data analysis.

2. Developed and executed a 6-week project plan simulating real-world consulting delivery.

3. Recommended data-driven UX improvements, increasing booking success by 200%+.

4. Communicated critical issues professionally and helped maintain client trust.

5. Used prioritization frameworks to recommend 5 initiatives within budget constraints.
